		<h1>reb4j</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to the home page for the Regular Expression Builder for Java (reb4j)
			library project.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of <b>reb4j</b> is to provide a pure Java wrapper around
			the regular expression syntax provided by the JRE's 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a> class.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>reb4j</b> provides the following benefits over writing regular expressions directly:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The <b>reb4j</b> API guarantees proper expression syntax.  
				If the Java code compiles, the regular expression will compile at runtime.  
				In other words, it is not necessary to deal with
				<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/PatternSyntaxException.html">PatternSyntaxException</a>s.
				You will know right away if there is a syntax error in your regular expression, rather than
				having to wait until runtime to find out. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The <b>reb4j</b> API enables composition of subexpressions.  Complex expressions
				can be broken into manageable pieces, each of which can be independently tested and
				reused.
			</li>
			<li>
				Patterns built using <b>reb4j</b> are inherently self-documenting
				(at least, moreso than regular expression sytax).
				Since composition is supported, each subexpression can be given a
				meaningful name that describes what it represents.
			</li>
			<li>
				Since <b>reb4j</b> hides regular expression syntax from the developer,
				there is no need to memorize (or repeatedly look up) what symbols
				represent which expression constructs, nor is it necessary to 
				"double-escape" strings (i.e., escaped once to override how the pattern
				compiler interprets special characters, and escaped again to fit into
				Java string literals).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Of course, this comes at the cost of a modest performance penalty at
			startup as <b>reb4j</b> builds strings to pass into the pattern
			compiler, but the time required for this processing is dwarfed by the
			time spent by the compiler itself and should not be noticeable.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a quick example, here's one way to use <b>reb4j</b> to describe a pattern 
			that validates the format of a dotted decimal IP address (ensuring that
			each octet is a decimal value between 0 and 255):
		</p>
		<pre>
	final Regex oneDigitOctet = 
		CharClass.POSIX_DIGIT;
	final Regex twoDigitOctet = 
		CharClass.range('1', '9').then(CharClass.POSIX_DIGIT);
	final Regex oneHundredsOctet =
		Regex.literal("1").then(CharClass.POSIX_DIGIT.repeat(2, 2));
	final Regex lowTwoHundredsOctet =
		Regex.literal("2").then(CharClass.range('0', '4')).then(CharClass.POSIX_DIGIT);
	final Regex highTwoHundredsOctet =
		Regex.literal("25").then(CharClass.range('0', '5'));
	final Regex octet =
		Regex.or(
				oneDigitOctet, 
				twoDigitOctet, 
				oneHundredsOctet, 
				lowTwoHundredsOctet, 
				highTwoHundredsOctet
			);
	final Regex dottedDecimalIPAddress =
		octet.then(Regex.literal(".")).repeat(3, 3).then(octet);
		
	final Pattern pattern = dottedDecimalIPAddress.toPattern();
	String input = "10.10.1.204";
	boolean valid = pattern.matcher(input).matches();
	
		</pre>
		<p>
			For reference, the generated regular expression looks like this
			(note that <b>reb4j</b> makes liberal use of "non-matching groups"):
		</p>
		<pre>(?:(?:(?:(?:\p{Digit}|(?:[1-9]\p{Digit})|(?:(?:1)(?:\p{Digit}{2}))|(?:(?:(?:2)[0-4])\p{Digit})|(?:(?:25)[0-5]))(?:\.)){3})(?:\p{Digit}|(?:[1-9]\p{Digit})|(?:(?:1)(?:\p{Digit}{2}))|(?:(?:(?:2)[0-4])\p{Digit})|(?:(?:25)[0-5])))</pre>
